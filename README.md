# Python-Projects
## This file includes all the python projects done by Max Hong Ka Ho and I am going to introduce you with the projects I have done so far: (In chronological order)

1. Predict Future HSI Stock Price Using Facebook Prophet:

This project uses a famous machine learning library - Facebook Prophet, I employ it to predict the HSI index price(the stock index of HKEX) where input is past stock prices and output is future stock prices. From this paper, I would shed light on whether this library works well in stock predictions which is an extremely complex system in real life.

2. Predict Stock Price Using Tensorflow and Scikit-Learn:

This is a project with integration of deep learning, statistics and finance. In our real life, we may easily find some stock csv files. However, can we build a model that inputs some common data like past Open, High, Low, Close, Volume and output the future close prices? We would embark on our journey to make one! The project here uses neural network in deep learning, multiple regression, random forest and decision making trees model with HSI data. They all have the same inputs in this experiment and output tomorrow's stock price. Detailed comparision in the 4 models will be studied with the help of statistical measures like accuracy, R_squared, MSE, etc.

3. Applying Neural Network to Construct a Trading Strategy In Stock:

Serving as the continuation of the last project, I really put them to backtest by separating the training and testing data set and use the predicted stock prices as signal for entry. Nonetheless, here we merely conduct experiment with neural network model. 

4. Pair Trading Strategy For Apple And Microsoft:

Pair Trading is a renowned trading strategy making decisions to buy and sell two pair of stocks after sophisticated mathematical analysis namely the cointegration and correlation analysis with sets of underlying assumptions need to be tested in order to make the results robust in practice. I would display how to use python on executing the model in real life. It starts from using hypothesis testing to testify whether the assumptions hold,then goes on with a few steps of standardization of data. Finally, backtest have been done on the test data.


It mainly targets python application to finance especially testing of algorithmic trading strategies 
People who are interested can feel free to play with the code written by me
